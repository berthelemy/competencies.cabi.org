Would you like to influence the development of this skills framework?

There is a lot to do...

- We want to extend the number of roles it covers.
- We want to create good descriptors for each skill.
- We want to get buy-in from countries and organisations across the world who will adopt the framework and use it with their people.

The framework is available for all to use under a Creative Commons license.

The Skills for Agriculture Working Group holds regular online workshops over at the CABI Academy. If you don't have a CABI Academy account, you will be asked to create one.
