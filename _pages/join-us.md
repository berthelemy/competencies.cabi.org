Would you like to influence the development of this skills framework?

There is a lot to do...

- We want to extend the number of roles it covers.
- We want to create good descriptors for each skill.
- We want to get buy-in from countries and organisations across the world who will adopt the framework and use it with their people.

The framework is available for all to use under a Creative Commons license. Consortium members have an additional license which allows them to use the framework for commercial purposes.

For more information about joining the consortium, please contact <a href="mailto: m.berthelemy@cabi.org">Mark Berthelemy</a>.
