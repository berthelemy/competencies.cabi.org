This skills framework gives a solid foundation on which to build:

- training needs analysis
- certifications
- training programmes
- job descriptions
- career plans

This website is currently owned by <a href="https://cabi.org" target="_blank">CABI</a> until we establish an independent body.

We are connected to the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Open Skills Network</a>: a coalition of organisations and other stakeholders dedicated to advancing skills-based education and hiring.

### How to use the framework

The skills are organised by:

- **Category**: Which groups together similar skills
- **Role**: Which groups together skills that apply more to particular roles
- **Level**: Which groups together skills that may apply more to people at particular stages in their career

We suggest that the framework is used to provide a common vocabulary when having conversations about standards, regulations, certification and training.

### Levels

**Foundation**: Someone who is an early stage in their career and works under supervision.

**Practitioner**: Someone who can work without supervision

**Advanced**: Someone who leads and provides direction
